					<p><em>Raspberry Pi:</em></p>
					<p>A credit-card sized computer that plugs into an HDMI capable
					display and a keyboard. The R-PI has a large user base that is
					heavily involved in electronics and programming projects.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="impterm">
					<p><em>XBee:</em></p>
					<p>Radio modules that utilize the Zigbee communication protocol, which
					is built for smaller low-power radios and based on the IEEE 802.15 standard.
					Due to its low power, range is limited to 10-100 meters line-of-sight, but
					its ability to form a mesh network of intermediate devices offers the possibility
					of transmitting data over long distances.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="impterm">
					<p><em>Mesh Topology:</em></p>
					<p>A network structure in which each node connected to every other node in 
					the structure. Nodes utilize hopping to reach a path from one node to another in
					the case that a connection between two nodes cannot be established. Due to this
					phenomenon, mesh topology is considered to be "self-healing", and is considered
					one of the more stable network structures available.</p>

				<p>Users must be able to access data that is processed and sent from the 
				trail nodes. This is done through a "Gateway" node, which is connected to
				the Internet.The "Gateway" node receives data from the trail nodes and stores 
				it in an SQL database. It also serves a web page associated with a domain name, 
				and can be accessed through any web browser by a limited user base.</p>

				<p>When initially designing the Gateway node, it was considered to host
				the database and website from a third party server. This idea was quickly reconsidered
				due to the need for a physical Gateway node to send data to that operated under
				the same protocol as child nodes within the mesh network. Also, hosting from a 
				third party provider costs money, and relinquishes some element of control.</p>

				<p>A <a class="inline" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry-Pi</a>
				was loaded with the Rasbian Operating System, which is
				a specific distribution of Linux made especially for the computer. By serving
				the website from the Pi, it incurred no additional cost and we had complete control
				over the SQL database construction and maintenance and Django installation and
				configuration. We were also able to connect it directly to an XBee module to 
				receive data from other nodes via the UART pins.</p>
				<p>When compared to other mini-computers such as the Beaglebone Black, the BBB
				offered such features as JavaScript driven hardware, a web interface, and 
				more video processor capability and power, but none of the added features were
				needed. For this reason, our familiarity with the R-Pi became the deciding factor 
				over which computer to choose. It would mainly be used to run Cron jobs, the main
				gateway process, serve the website, and run a lightweight database, which was
				handled very well by the Samsung processor. Due to the limited number of users
				which will have access to the website, server bandwidth is not a concern.</p>

					<figcaption class="design">Gateway Node Processes</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>The "Gateway Process" described in the figure above involved design and
				implementation of a customized C++ program that would accept commands via HTTP
				from other processes, and execute them. In this manner, the Gateway serves as the
				bridge between the trail nodes and the database. It also notifies the admins by 
				email or SMS if something bad happens to the nodes or the server, and allows the
				admin to put the nodes into sleep mode and wake them from sleep should the need arise.</p>
				<p>HTTP was chosen as the communications protocol between nodes since a great deal
				of interprocess communication occurs within the network. Choices for interprocess
				communication methods were:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Reading and writing to a file, or groups of files</li>
					<li>Using interrupts and signals to intercommunicate</li>
					<li>Using network sockets to translate information</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Due to the fact that implementation is fairly straightforward, and the resident
				C++ expert is somewhat of a lazy engineer, an HTTP library was used to implement
				socket I/O between processes. HTTP Post requests required a URL to post to and send
				data. For this, the local-host of the attached router was used. From the node side,
				a string is sent to the Gateway over RF with the URL and data separated by a delimiter
				character. The Gateway would then receive and split out the URL and data and perform a
				post request to itself. This was done using a simple Curl sub-process.</p>

						 alt="Gateway Program Sequence Diagram" width="450" height="446"></a>
					<figcaption class="design">Gateway Program Sequence</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>As shown in the sequence diagram above (click on it for a closer look), the UART waits for an HTTP string
				to be received, and then parses it into a message that it can interpret and post to 
				the HTTP server. The server then parses the post request, checks for validity,
				adds an event to the event queue, and returns to the listening state. The program
				was optimized for minimal CPU downtime, and no wasted cycles.</p>
				<p>Gateway to node communication will most likely not be HTTP, since we will need
				to run a server on the PIXYCam, which is excessive. A custom protocol will need to be
				developed that is lightweight, and interpretable by the on-board processors. </p>
				<p>Additional functionality for the trail nodes will be accomplished through Cron jobs
				on the main server. For instance, when the trail nodes need to be placed in a low power
				state during the evening hours, a script will run at a specified time on the Gateway
				and send a remote command to power save to all of the nodes. The Cron jobs will
				run a Curl command, and HTTP post to the Gateway process at times specified in the 
				Crontab. </p>

					<figcaption class="design">Debug Console</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>The debug console shown above was developed in order to test certain node features,
				such as the ability to send SMS messages in case a node is in a bad state. It operates
				by manually sending commands to the Gateway process. A Curl command is used to send
				HTTP post requests, as in the example above.</p>
				<p>A MariaDB backend was chosen as a drop in replacement for MySQL due to its non-
				Oracle origin, and the fact that it is more open. The Gateway process communicates with 
				it via a C API, and the Website communicates with it via a Django helper class.</p>

				<p>The figure above shows the schema of our database (click on it for a closer look). It has changed over
				the design process, but the general idea has been to utilize Django's web framework
				to create database objects that can interrelate between "foreign key" relationships. The
                picture above shows all non-Django database tables created.</p>
