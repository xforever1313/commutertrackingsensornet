				<h3>Prototyping a Texas Instruments BQ25504</h3>
				<p>The TIBQ25504 is a high efficiency battery management system that requires a certain
				amount of configuration to achieve desired values at the V<sub>BAT</sub> and V<sub>STOR</sub>
				pins.  In addition, the boost converter has a built in status signal that can be connected
				to a micro-controller and utilized as desired.</p>
				<p>Configuring the over-voltage and under-voltage thresholds for the attached battery simply
				reduces or expands the range of voltages that the device can produce under varying degrees
				of load and levels of battery charge. The device also allows the programmer to set a MPP to maximize
				the power produced by the connected sustainable source.</p>
				<p>Due to limitations of the Evaluation Module for the battery management device,  a slightly more
				complicated procedure was used to test the hardware. This process is outlined as follows:</p>
				<ol class="procedure">
					<li>Download TI's <a class="inline" href="http://www.ti.com/lit/zip/sluraq1">spreadsheet tool</a>
					and enter the desired parameters depending on the battery being used. A good MPPT configuration
					to start off with is 80% of maximum voltage. This can be tweaked later on in the prototyping process. </li>
					<li>Download the <a class="inline" href="http://www.ti.com/lit/zip/slum238">SPICE model</a>
					for the device and run a transient analysis after replacing the included resistors with the values
					calculated in the spreadsheet tool. This can be done using OrCad Cadence or other SPICE software.</li>
					<li>Verify that V<sub>BAT</sub> and V<sub>STOR</sub> values are as expected, and make any
					necessary modifications, adjusting the spreadsheet and simulating with the new values.</li>
					<li>Obtain a QFN to DIP converter from a reliable source. The example pictured was purchased
					from dEcolectrix, a company in Edderitz, Germany that specializes in custom PCB design. Ensure that
					the model chosen has a 3x3mm body and 0.5mm pitch between pins. Purchase 16x breakaway headers, the bq25504
					and the required resistors, capacitors, and inductors as specified in the 
					<a class="inline" href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq25504.pdf">device manual</a> and the spreadsheet.</li>
					<!-- INSERT PICTURE OF QFN TO DIP CONVERTER HERE -->
					<li>Use any re-flow soldering technique necessary to adhere the QFN chip to the PCB. Since the leads
					are on the bottom of the chip, traditional means of soldering are not an option. This can be done 
					through use of professional facilities, or by creating a customized <a class="inline" 
					href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/the-poor-mans-solder-reflow-oven">soldering oven</a>. 
					Be sure to align pin one with the correct pin on the board for proper pin numbering. </li>
					<li>Build the circuit on a breadboard and check voltage characteristics at the V<sub>BAT</sub> and 
					V<sub>STOR</sub> outputs without load or battery. Make any necessary adjustments to obtain values 
					similar to those obtained in OrCad. Keep in mind that the breadboard will never perform as well as a custom PCB. Also,
					the over-voltage threshold will dictate the highest voltage produced by the boost converter, and this value should
					not exceed the maximum voltage allowed by the storage element. For example, a Li-Ion battery should not be charged
					at higher than 4.2V to prevent electroplating.</li>
					<li>Connect the battery (to the V<sub>BAT</sub> pin) before and after cold-start to verify cold-start functionality. </li>
					<li>Perform cold-start with the battery connected, and connect the desired load to the V<sub>STOR</sub> pin. The
					voltage should drop at both pins slightly as voltage is exchanged for current. Note that if the voltage drops below
					the under-voltage threshold, the boost converter will cut power to the load, and voltage will drop on the 
					V<sub>STOR</sub> pin. If this occurs, the under-voltage threshold should be reconsidered to allow
					for the voltage drop.</li>
					<li>The V<sub>BAT OK</sub> signal should be configured to hold high for the interval from V<sub>STOR</sub> high
					when load is connected to V<sub>STOR</sub> low when load is connected, and the under-voltage threshold is almost reached.
					Keep the battery chemistry in mind when choosing this low threshold as well. For instance Li-Ion batteries should not be
					discharged below a certain voltage (3.0V - 3.2V) with load attached.</li>
					<li>Run the prototype for extended periods. If possible, run until over-voltage and under-voltage thresholds are reached.
					Check battery voltage when fully depleted and fully charged to characterize the battery for MPPT. Use formulas in the 
					data sheet to figure out the maximum power point, and enter this into the spreadsheet to tweak its corresponding
					resistor net.</li>
