				<h4>Important terms</h4>
				<div class="impterm">
					<p><em>Django:</em></p>
					<p>A free an open source web application framework, written in Python, which 
					follows the model-view-controller architectural pattern.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="impterm">
					<p><em>UART:</em></p>
					<p>Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter. A hardware component that allows
					translation of data between parallel and serial forms. They are commonly used to 
					transfer serial data through a USB interface.</p>
				</div>
			</aside>
			
			<div id="section">
				<p>Users that have any vested interest in the data that is sent to the Gateway
				server from the nodes can access that data through a website, also served from the Pi.
				Django provides the framework for the website, which is implemented largely in Python,
				however some HTML and CSS is required within the Python template language to get 
				web pages to render as desired.</p>

					<img src="../media/pictures/websitemockup.bmp" 
						 alt="Website Mockup" width="500" height="372">
					<figcaption class="design">Website Preliminary Layout</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>As shown above in early versions of the website design, the site can be accessed
				to view such things as data from the trails and status of the nodes (such as battery readings).
				It can also be used by admins to control the nodes remotely, allowing for power cycling 
				and putting nodes in a low-power state. This is highly beneficial due to the size of the
				trail, the distance between nodes, and the time it would take to access and maintain them
				on foot.</p>
				<figure class="design">
					<img src="../media/pictures/websitemockup2.bmp" 
						 alt="Maintenance Mode" width="500" height="377">
					<figcaption class="design">Maintenance Mode Status</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>The figure above shows the Maintenance Mode message page for a node. As shown, it displays
				all messages sent from the node to the Gateway regarding informations, warnings, and errors.</p>
				<figure class="design">
					<img src="../media/pictures/websitemockup3.bmp" 
						 alt="Node Down" width="500" height="382">
					<figcaption class="design">Node Down Status</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Hardware maintenance can be performed remotely through the Node Down maintenance page, where
				the user can press a reset or power button to power cycle a mode in a bad state, given that
				the state in which it is in is recoverable.</p>
				<h3>Gateway Node and Website Risks</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Security
						<ul>
							<li>SSH Keys are required to login via SSH</li>
							<li>SSH and HTTP ports are not default</li>
							<li>IP addresses are banned after multiple failed attempts</li>
							<li>Unneeded ports are CLOSED, or hidden behind the router's firewall</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Hard Drive Space
						<ul>
							<li>11 GB left on pi (should be plenty)</li>
							<li>Can upgrade SD card</li>
							<li>Can use external Hard drive as primary hard drive
								<ul>
									<li>SD card will only be for booting</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Lack of Processing Power
						<ul>
							<li>No problems yet</li>
							<li>Database, Website, and Gateway Program can each go on their own pi if needed</li>
							<li>Code is cross-platform (for Linux), "easy" to upgrade to a more powerful system</li>
							<li>Will most likely be a low traffic site</li>
							<li>Gateway Program uses no CPU unless something is happening</li>
							<li>PI is stripped down
								<ul>
									<li>No GUI, several things are not installed</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Testing Strategy for Gateway and Website</h3>
				<p>Unit Tests will be written to find small bugs early. At present time, C++ has been used to
				write upwards of 180 unit tests. The debug console can be used to run manual integration tests,
				and tests exist so far for sending email, sending SMS, logging error messages, sending UART 
				messages, and shutting down Gateway processes.</p>
					<p>Security testing will involve allowing a small team of RIT security majors to penetration
				test the server, reporting any flaws in design.</p>
