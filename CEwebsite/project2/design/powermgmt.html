				<p>The custom PCB that handles power management and routing
				for each sensor node is made up of three stages: signal acquisition,
				conditioning and storage, and level-shifting.</p>
				<p>Signal is acquired from the Windbelt sustainability element
				and sent to a half-wave rectifier, where approximately 1.8V AC at 25MPH
				wind gusts is converted to about 1.5V of pulsating DC.</p>

				<p>Signal is routed into a boost converter, which is made specifically
				for nano-scale harvesting. It works to trickle charge a Li-Ion battery
				by providing 4.1V from a minimum of 550mV of AC from the power source. The
				boost converter also provides fail-safe mechanisms that inhibit the current
				produced when input voltage would otherwise drive output over the safe
				level of 4.2V for a lithium-ion battery.</p>
				<p>The current is boosted when levels are lower than 3.2V through an 
				algorithm called MPPT. This is done by continuously sampling input voltage
				at one of the pins of the device, and utilizing about 80% of the voltage
				that is sampled at the pin.</p>

				</figure>
				<p>The 3.7V DC coming from the boost converter is routed to two different
				components: a PixyCam embedded camera and an XBee radio module. Since
				a different voltage is required to power each, specialized amplifiers
				are needed to convert 3.7V to 9V for the camera and to 3.3V for the radio.</p>
				<p>A low-power DC to DC boost converter that offers features such as low
				quiescent current and high gain is shown in the figure below. The boost
				converter is commonly used in cell phone applications, and for LCD displays
				to supply a high efficiency power source over the entire operating range
				of the attached device.</p>

				</figure>
				<p>A low-noise, low-power DC to DC buck converter will be configured
				for a 3.3V output by using the supplied pin select configuration. The
				buck converter offers features such as a low quiescent current, DCS-Control,
				and low output ripple. Common applications include Bluetooth Low Energy,
				and Zigbee communication.</p>

				</figure>
				<p>Attached devices operate in a variety of modes. For instance, the 
				XBee modules are able to enter a low power state, and draw more current
				while transmitting data. The PixyCam has similar features, drawing more
				current while performing CV algorithms. For this reason, power supplies
				must be able to dynamically adjust the load current to meet the demands
				of the device, which poses a difficult design problem.</p>
				<p>The storage element that was chosen for the project was a 15600mAh
				Tenergy battery pack that provides 3.7V. It is relatively lightweight, and
				provides overcharge and discharge protection. Coupled with a smart charger
				to provide initial charge conditions, it should be more than adequate. Care
				must be taken to provide no more than 4.2V to the battery, or risk damage
				and capacity decay. This risk is mitigated by providing an over-voltage
				threshold that is programmed into the BQ25504 boost converter.</p>
				
				<h4>Power Module Routing</h4>
				<p>Texas Instruments provides a BXL file that can be converted into a script
				that allows it to be interpreted by custom PCB design programs like EAGLE. First,
				transient analysis with SPICE must be performed to get an idea for all passive 
				component values and how dynamic components should be configured for use. Then,
				the values used in successful simulations can be confirmed in the design of the 
				schematic and layout in EAGLE.</p>
				<p>There are many important factors to consider when finalizing layout, such as
				placement of power and ground planes. Often times they must be isolated between 
				noise sensitive components to minimize interference.</p>
				<h4>Power Module Risks</h4>
				<p>There is still a slight risk that current from the Windbelt will be too low
				to work with at the boost converter level once the associated load is connected
				to it. Proof of concept will be provided to eliminate this concern once the 
				primary boost converter is connected to the secondary components and tested.</p>
				<p>Concern that the battery may be under or overvolted has also been mitigated,
				seeing that the battery itself has a protection circuit, and the boost converter
				provides protection through its configuration as well.</p>
				<p>A new concern that is arising is the amount of noise that will be present in
				the circuit due to EMI and RFI. This will be mitigated by providing a multi-layer
				PCB design, that can help reduce overall interference by up to 20dB.</p>
				<h4>Power Module Test Plan</h4>
				<ul> 
					<li>Boost Converter
						<ul> 
							<li>Connect the boost converter via a QFN to DIP converter and test
							output levels when not configured for MPPT, or OV/UV with a resistive load.</li>
							<li>Do the same for MPPT and OV/UV.</li>
							<li>Add the battery and perform the same tests.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Custom PCB
						<ul> 
							<li>Test for continuity.</li>
							<li>Test voltage levels to make sure they match the specifications for
							each major component.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Li-Ion Battery
						<ul> 
							<li>Connect battery and test rate of discharge and cut-off functionality.</li>
							<li>Measure charge duration over extended periods of use.</li>
						</ul>
